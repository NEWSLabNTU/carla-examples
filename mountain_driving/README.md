# Mountain Driving Example on Carla Simulator

This example creates a scenario on a mountain path and puts a car on
at the beginning of the path. You're asked to fill in the ageng code
at
[`mountain_driving/agent/student.py`](mountain_driving/agent/student.py)
to control the car. The car must read the camera images or Lidar point
clouds to apply appropriate control to follow the lane.

Please the the top-level [README](../README.md) to learn the usage.
